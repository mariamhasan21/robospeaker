This simple Python program uses the pyttsx3 library to convert text input into speech. Users can type any text, and the program will vocalize it. The program will continue running and speaking inputs until the user decides to exit by typing "q".

**Features**
```
    Text-to-Speech Conversion: Enter any text, and the program will read it aloud.

    Looped Input: Users can continuously enter new text for conversion.

    Exit Option: Typing "q" will stop the program and end the session.
```
Note: Ensure the pyttsx3 library is installed before running this program.
